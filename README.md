## Instructions

You have two options: if you are comfortable with git/GitHub, fork this repo.
Otherwise:

-   Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".

-   Unzip the zip archive.

-   The folder is a Quarto Project with the assessment template in `report.qmd`.
    Use that file to complete the assessment (feel free to create extra files/directories, but note that for the submission you will upload a single PDF created from `report.qmd`, see below).

-   You can render `report.qmd` as HTML or PDF using the `Render` button.

-   For the submission, **render to PDF and change the name of the file to your exam number.**

- **We will test that your code runs without errors and that your results are fully reproducible**. You can choose how to share and where to host the study repository. Whatever method you choose, make sure the link to the repository is included in your report.
